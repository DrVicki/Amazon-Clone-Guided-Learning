# Amazon-Clone-Guided-Learning

## Build an Amazon Clone Step-By-Step

In this Guided Learning, we will make the Amazon Clone using React. 
- We will also be using Firebase for Authentication, Database, Functions and Hosting.
  - Firebase is a great tool to get started with projects quickly. 
- We will also be using HTML, CSS, and React Context API. 

**Please keep in mind, you need to have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.**

Are you ready? LETâ€™S GOOOOO ðŸ”¥ ðŸš€

Letâ€™s make a new folder named ```amazon-clone``` and open it. 
- As soon as you are in the folder, right click and select Open With Code.

After you click Open with Code, youâ€™ll see a huge weird window. Donâ€™t worry we got you covered. This is what you might be seeing:

**Visual Studio Code** is the Code Editor we are going to use; this is what professionals mostly use, but this is more of a personal preference. You can use Atom or any other editor too, but Visual Studio Code makes your life easier.

Now that in you are in Visual Studio Code, Press Ctrl + J (on Windows) and ```Command + J``` (on Mac) and you should see a terminal window at the bottom just like shown below.
